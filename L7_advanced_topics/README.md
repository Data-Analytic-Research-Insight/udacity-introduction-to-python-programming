## L7-1. Advanced Topics

- **iterable**: objects that can return one of their elements at a time, such as a **list**
  - Many of the built-in functions we’ve used so far, like 'enumerate' return an iterator.
- **iterator**: objects that represents a stream of data.
  - `list` is iterable, but not iterator. Because it's not a stream of data
- **generator**: a simple way to create iterators using functions
  - we can also define iterators using classes, read more [here](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#iterators)
