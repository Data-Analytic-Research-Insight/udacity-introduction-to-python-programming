## L6-1. Introduction

- goal: write and run our scripts locally on our computers
- we'll learn about:
  - Python Installation and Environment Setup
  - Running and Editing Python Scripts
  - Interacting with User Input
  - Handling Exceptions
  - Reading and Writing Files
  - Importing Local, Standard, and Third-Party Modules
  - Experimenting with an Interpreter

## L6-2. Python Installation

### Before We Install Python:

#### 1. Prepare to Use Command Line

- recommend to reinforce Unix Shell commands: [Shell Workshop | Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/shell-workshop--ud206)

#### 2. Is Python Already Installed On Your Computer?

- In this course, we're using the most recent major version of Python - Python 3
- Mac OS X and Linux usually come with Python 2 already installed. We **DO NOT** recommend that you make any changes to this Python, since parts of the operating system are using Python
- we can type commands in terminal to check whether python is installed

  ```shell
  python --version
  ```

## L6-8. Scripting with Raw Input

### `input()`: input a str

- this is a demo with `input()`

  ```py
  name = input('Enter a name: ')
  print('Hello', name.title())
  ```

- now we input a name `alan`, it'll output the string `Hello Alan`

  ```
  $ python3 input_demo.py
  Enter a name: alan
  Hello Alan
  ```

### `input()`: input a int, float

- if we want to input a integer...

  ```py
  num = input('Enter a number: ')
  num += 20
  print(num)
  ```

- it'll show `TypeError`

  ```
  $ python3 input_demo.py
  Enter a number: 5
  Traceback (most recent call last):
    File "tempCodeRunnerFile.python", line 2, in <module>
      num += 20
  TypeError: can only concatenate str (not "int") to str
  ```

- because we need to convert type into `int` by using method `int()`

  ```py
  num = int(input('Enter a number: '))
  num += 20
  print(num)
  ```

- as long as we input a integer, the output will as our expected

  ```
  $ python3 input_demo.py
  Enter a number: 5
  25
  ```

- but if the input isn't integer, there's a `ValueError`

  ```
  $ python3 input_demo.py
  Enter a number: 4.5
  Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "tempCodeRunnerFile.python", line 1, in <module>
    num = int(input('Enter a number: '))
  ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '4.5'
  ```

- we need to convert type to `float()` just like this:

  ```py
  num = float(input('Enter a number: '))
  num += 20
  print(num)
  ```

- output:

  ```
  $ python3 input_demo.py
  Enter a number: 4.5
  24.5
  ```

---

- but what if we need an integer, like multiplying a string by it to repeat it a certain number of times?

  ```py
  num = float(input('Enter a number: '))
  print('hello' * num)
  ```

- this wouldn't work even if we input an integer nubmer

  ```
  $ python3 input_demo.py
  Enter a number: 3
  Traceback (most recent call last):
    File "tempCodeRunnerFile.python", line 2, in <module>
      print('hello' * num)
  TypeError: can't multiply sequence by non-int of type 'float'
  ```

- we can wrap `float()` within `int()` to convert to int

  ```py
  num = int(float(input('Enter a number: ')))
  print('hello' * num)
  ```

- that works

  ```
  $ python3 input_demo.py
  Enter a number: 3
  hellohellohello
  ```

- imagine and handle every possible case is important!
- we'll learn a better way to handle these scenarios in the next section

### `eval()`

- here's another way we can interpret user input
- `eval()`: a built-in function that evaluate a string as line in Python

  ```py
  x = eval(input('Enter an expression: '))
  print(x)
  ```

- output:

  ```
  $ python3 input_demo.py
  Enter an expression: 25 + 32
  57
  ```

- we can even include a variable like this:

  ```py
  num = 30
  x = eval('num + 42')
  print(x)
  ```

- output:

  ```
  $ python3 input_demo.py
  72
  ```

## L6-9. Quiz: Scripting with Raw Input

### Quiz: Generate Messages

Imagine you're a teacher who needs to send a message to each of your students reminding them of their missing assignments and grade in the class. You have each of their names, number of missing assignments, and grades on a spreadsheet and just have to insert them into placeholders in this message you came up with:

```
Hi [insert student name],

This is a reminder that you have [insert number of missing assignments] assignments left to submit before you can graduate. Your current grade is [insert current grade] and can increase to [insert potential grade] if you submit all assignments before the due date.
```

You can just copy and paste this message to each student and manually insert the appropriate values each time, but instead you're going to write a program that does this for you.

Write a script that does the following:

1. Ask for user input 3 times. Once for a list of names, once for a list of missing assignment counts, and once for a list of grades. Use this input to create lists for `names`, `assignments`, and `grades`.
2. Use a loop to print the message for each student with the correct values. The potential grade is simply the current grade added to two times the number of missing assignments.

---

- my solution:
- file: [message.py](code/message/message.py)

  ```py
  names = input('Enter names separated by commas: ').title().split(',') # get and process input for a list of names
  assignments = input('Enter assignments count separated by commas: ').split(',') # get and process input for a list of the number of assignments
  grades = input('Enter grade separated by commas: ').split(',') # get and process input for a list of grades

  # message string to be used for each student
  # HINT: use .format() with this string in your for loop
  message = "Hi {},\n\nThis is a reminder that you have {} assignments left to \
  submit before you can graduate. You're current grade is {} and can increase \
  to {} if you submit all assignments before the due date.\n\n"

  # write a for loop that iterates through each set of names, assignments, and grades to print each student's message
  for name, assignment, grade in zip(names, assignments, grades):
      print(message.format(name, assignment, grade, int(grade) + int(assignment)*2))
  ```

- note
  - we have to do `.title()` before `.split(',')`
    - the type of `names` is `str` before `.split(',')`, otherwise is `list`
  - `.split(',')`: separated by commas
  - `zip(names, assignments, grades)`: it's useful to use `zip()` here
  - `int(grade) + int(assignment)*2`: we should convert `assignment` to `int` at first, otherwise it will repeats the string of `assignment` two times

- input: [message.input](code/message/message.input)

  ```
  chandler bing,phoebe buffay,monica geller,ross geller
  3,6,0,2
  81,77,92,88
  ```

- output:

  ```
  $ python3 message.py < message.input
  Enter names separated by commas: Enter assignments count separated by commas: Enter grade separated by commas: Hi Chandler Bing,

  This is a reminder that you have 3 assignments left to submit before you can graduate. You're current grade is 81 and can increase to 8
  7 if you submit all assignments before the due date.


  Hi Phoebe Buffay,

  This is a reminder that you have 6 assignments left to submit before you can graduate. You're current grade is 77 and can increase to 8
  9 if you submit all assignments before the due date.


  Hi Monica Geller,

  This is a reminder that you have 0 assignments left to submit before you can graduate. You're current grade is 92 and can increase to 9
  2 if you submit all assignments before the due date.


  Hi Ross Geller,

  This is a reminder that you have 2 assignments left to submit before you can graduate. You're current grade is 88 and can increase to 92 if you submit all assignments before the due date.
  ```

- note
  - we can input from file by using `< filename`

## L6-11. Errors and Exceptions

### Errors

- **Syntax errors** occur when Python **canât interpret** our code, since we didnât follow the correct syntax for Python.
- These are errors youâre likely to get when you make a typo, or youâre first starting to learn Python.

- file: [errors_demo.py](code/errors_and_exceptions/errors_demo.py)

  ```py
  msg = 'Welcome to this program!
  print(msg)
  ```

- output:

  ```
  $ python3 errors_demo.py
    File "tempCodeRunnerFile.python", line 1
      msg = 'Welcome to this program!
                                    ^
  SyntaxError: EOL while scanning string literal
  ```

### Exceptions

- **Exceptions** occur when unexpected things happen **during execution** of a program, even if the code is syntactically correct
- There are different types of built-in exceptions in Python, and you can see which exception is thrown in the error message.

- file: [exceptions_demo1.py](code/errors_and_exceptions/exceptions_demo1.py)

  ```py
  x = int(input('Enter a number: '))
  x += 20
  print(x)
  ```

- output:

  ```
  $ python3 exceptions_demo1.py
  Enter a number: ten
  Traceback (most recent call last):
    File "exceptions_demo1.py", line 1, in <module>
      x = int(input('Enter a number: '))
  ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'ten'
  ```

  - `ValueError` occurs when a built-in operation or function is given an argument with the correct type but an inappropriate value

- file: [exceptions_demo2.py](code/errors_and_exceptions/exceptions_demo2.py)

  ```py
  print(nonexistent_variable)
  ```

- output:

  ```
    File "exceptions_demo2.py", line 1, in <module>
      print(nonexistent_variable)
  NameError: name 'nonexistent_variable' is not defined
  ```

## L6-12. Quiz: Errors and Exceptions

- Q2: Here are some of the common exceptions programmers run into in Python. Do some research online to match the appropriate description for each.

    | BUILT-IN EXCEPTION | DESCRIPTION                                                                                                   |
    | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | ValueError         | An object of the correct type but inappropriate value is passed as input to a built-in operation or function. |
    | AssertionError     | An assert statement fails.                                                                                    |
    | IndexError         | A sequence subscript is out of range.                                                                         |
    | KeyError           | A key can't be found in a dictionary.                                                                         |
    | TypeError          | An object of an unsupported type is passed as input to an operation or function.                              |

## L6-13. Handling Errors

### Try Statement

#### Without Errors Handling

- file: [demo1.py](code/handling_errors/demo1.py)

  ```py
  x = int(input('Enter a number: '))
  ```

- output

  ```
  $ python3 demo1.py
  Enter a number: nope
  Traceback (most recent call last):
    File "demo1.py", line 1, in <module>
      x = int(input('Enter a number: '))
  ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'nope'
  ```

#### With Errors Handling

- file: [demo2.py](code/errors_and_exceptions/demo2.py)

  ```py
  try:
      x = int(input('Enter a number: '))
  except:
      print('That\'s not a valid number')

  print('\nAttempted Input\n')
  ```

- output

  ```
  $ python3 demo2.py
  Enter a number: nope
  That's not a valid number

  Attempted Input
  ```

#### Keep running until user input a valid number

- file: [demo3.py](code/errors_and_exceptions/demo3.py)

  ```py
  while True:
      try:
          x = int(input('Enter a number: '))
          break
      except:
          print('That\'s not a valid number!')

      print('\nAttempted Input\n')
  ```

- output

  ```
  $ python3 demo3.py
  Enter a number: ten
  That's not a valid number!

  Attempted Input

  Enter a number: hello
  That's not a valid number!

  Attempted Input

  Enter a number: 10
  ```

### Finally

- `finally`: Before Python leaves this `try` statement, it will run the code in this `finally` block under any conditions, even if it's ending the program. E.g., if Python ran into an error while running code in the `except` or `else` block, this `finally` block will still be executed before stopping the program.
- the `finally` block is useful for cleaning up actions in the code.
  - later in this course, we will use `finally` to close file after attempting to open in a try statement.

- file: [demo4.py](code/errors_and_exceptions/demo4.py)

  ```py
  while True:
      try:
          x = int(input('Enter a number: '))
          break
      except:
          print('That\'s not a valid number!')
      finally:
          print('\nAttempted Input\n')
  ```

- output

  ```
  $ python3 demo4.py
  Enter a number: hello
  That's not a valid number!

  Attempted Input

  Enter a number: hi
  That's not a valid number!

  Attempted Input

  Enter a number: 10

  Attempted Input

  ```

### Specifying Exceptions

- In the [demo4.py](code/errors_and_exceptions/demo4.py), if we exit the program with Ctrl + C, it doesn't stop the program
  - because the expect handle any error, including the KeyboardInterrupt error

  ```
  $ python3 demo4.py
  Enter a number: ^CThat's not a valid number!

  Attempted Input

  Enter a number: 10

  Attempted Input

  ```

- we can specify which error we want to handle

  ```py
  try:
      # some code
  except ValueError:
      # some code
  ```

  - code: [demo5.py](code/handling_errors/demo5.py)

    ```py
    while True:
        try:
            x = int(input('Enter a number: '))
            break
        except ValueError:
            print('That\'s not a valid number!')
        finally:
            print('\nAttempted Input\n')
    ```

  - output

    ```
    $ python3 demo5.py
    Enter a number: hello
    That's not a valid number!

    Attempted Input

    Enter a number: ^C
    Attempted Input

    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "demo5.py", line 3, in <module>
        x = int(input('Enter a number: '))
    KeyboardInterrupt
    ```

  - `KeyboardInterrupt` Error wasn't handled, so this program crashed.
  - reminder: although the program crashed, this code in the `finally` block was still executed.

- If we want this handler to address more than one type of exception, we can include a **parenthesized tuple** after the `except` with the exceptions.

  ```py
  try:
      # some code
  except (ValueError, KeyboardInterrupt):
      # some code
  ```

  - code: [demo6.py](code/handling_errors/demo6.py)

    ```py
    while True:
        try:
            x = int(input('Enter a number: '))
            break
        except (ValueError, KeyboardInterrupt):
            print('That\'s not a valid number!')
        finally:
            print('\nAttempted Input\n')
    ```

  - output

    ```
    $ python3 demo6.py
    Enter a number: ten
    That's not a valid number!

    Attempted Input

    Enter a number: ^CThat's not a valid number!

    Attempted Input

    Enter a number: 10

    Attempted Input

    ```

- we can also execute different blocks of code depending on the exception, you can have multiple except blocks.

  ```py
  try:
      # some code
  except ValueError:
      # some code
  except KeyboardInterrupt:
      # some code
  ```

  - [demo7.py](code/handling_errors/demo7.py)

      ```py
      while True:
          try:
              x = int(input('Enter a number: '))
              break
          except ValueError:
              print('That\'s not a valid number!')
          except KeyboardInterrupt:
              print('\nNo input taken')
              break # don't forget to add break statement
          finally:
              print('\nAttempted Input\n')
      ```

  - output

    ```
    $ python3 demo7.py
    Enter a number: hello
    That's not a valid number!

    Attempted Input

    Enter a number: ^C
    No input taken

    Attempted Input

    ```

## L6-16. Accessing Error Messages

- When we handle an exception, we can still access its error message ike this:

```py
try:
    # some code
except ZeroDivisionError as e:
   # some code
   print("ZeroDivisionError occurred: {}".format(e))
```

- output:

  ```
  ZeroDivisionError occurred: integer division or modulo by zero
  ```

- If we don't have specific error to handle, we can still access error message by using `except Exception:`

  ```py
  try:
      # some code
  except Exception as e:
    # some code
    print("Exception occurred: {}".format(e))
  ```

  - `Exception` is just the base class for all built-in exceptions. Learn more at [Built-in Exceptions â Python 3.8.3 documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#Exception)

## L6-17. Reading and Writing Files

### Reading a File

```py
f = open('my_path/my_file.txt', 'r')
file_data = f.read()
f.close()
```

1. open the file using built-in method `open()`, it returns a file object.
   - there're optional parameters we can specify in Python. Here we use `r` for read only. This's the default value for the mode argument.
2. use the `read()` method to access the contents from the file object.
3. when finished with the file, don't forget to use `close()` to free up memory.

### Writing to a File

```py
f = open('my_path/my_file.txt', 'w')
f.write("Hello there!")
f.close()
```

1. open the file in writing(`w`) mode
   - if the file doesn't exist, python will create it for us
   - if we open an existed file, any contents contained previously will be deleted
   - if we don't want to add files without deleting contents, we should use append(`a`) mode
2. use the `write()` method to write text to a file
3. close the file when finished

### Too Many Open Files

- we shouldn't open too many files without close it.

  ```py
  files = []
  for i in range(10000):
      files.append(open('some_file.txt', 'r'))
      print(i)
  ```

- output

  ```

### With

- Python provides a special syntax that auto-closes a file for us once we're finished using it.

  ```py
  with open('my_path/my_file.txt', 'r') as f:
      file_data = f.read()
      # we don't need to close a file manually

  print(f) # (X) we can only access the file object within 'with' scope
  print(file_data) # (O) we can still access variable outside 'with' scope
  ```

## L6-18. Quiz: Reading and Writing Files

### Calling the `read` Method with an Integer

- if we don't pass any argument to `f.read()`, this defaults to reading all the remainder of the file from its current position
- if we pass with integer argument, it will read up to that number of characters, output all of them, and keep the 'window' at that position ready to read on.

- input: camelot.txt

  ```
  We're the knights of the round table
  We dance whenever we're able
  ```

- script

  ```py
  with open("camelot.txt") as song:
      print(song.read(2))
      print(song.read(8))
      print(song.read())
  ```

- output

  ```
  We
  're the 
  knights of the round table
  We dance whenever we're able
  ```

### Reading Line by Line

- `\n`s in blocks of text are newline characters.

#### f.readline()

- we can use `f.readline()` to read a single line from the file

  ```py
  with open("camelot.txt") as f:
      print(f.readline())
      print(f.readline())
  ```

- output
  - there're unnecessary new lines

  ```
  We're the knights of the round table

  We dance whenever we're able

  ```

- we can use `.strip()` to remove the unnecessary new lines

  ```py
  with open("camelot.txt") as f:
      print(f.readline().strip())
      print(f.readline().strip())
  ```

- output

  ```
  We're the knights of the round table
  We dance whenever we're able
  ```

#### for line in file

- Conveniently, Python will loop over the lines of a file using the syntax `for line in file`.

  ```py
  camelot_lines = []
  with open("camelot.txt") as f:
      for line in f:
          camelot_lines.append(line.strip())

  print(camelot_lines)
  ```

- output

  ```
  ["We're the knights of the round table", "We dance whenever we're able"]
  ```

- we use `.strip()` to remove trailing `\n` before, if we don't add `.strip()`:

  ```py
  camelot_lines = []
  with open("camelot.txt") as f:
      for line in f:
          camelot_lines.append(line)

  print(camelot_lines)
  ```

- output
  - every elements except for last element will have a trailing `\n`

  ```
  ["We're the knights of the round table\n", "We dance whenever we're able"]
  ```

#### f.readlines()

- or we can just use `f.readlines()`

  ```py
  with open("camelot.txt") as f:
      print(f.readlines())
  ```

- output
  - every elements except for last element will have a trailing `\n`

  ```
  ["We're the knights of the round table\n", "We dance whenever we're able"]
  ```

- we can't just add `.strip()` after `readlines()`, because it returns an list

  ```py
  with open("camelot.txt") as f:
      print(f.readlines().strip())
  ```

- output

  ```
  Traceback (most recent call last):
    File "tempCodeRunnerFile.python", line 2, in <module>
      print(f.readlines().strip())
  AttributeError: 'list' object has no attribute 'strip'
  ```

### Quiz: Flying Circus Cast List

- You're going to create a list of the actors who appeared in the television programme Monty Python's Flying Circus.
- Write a function called `create_cast_list` that takes a filename as input and returns a list of actors' names. It will be run on the file `flying_circus_cast.txt` (this information was collected from imdb.com). Each line of that file consists of an actor's name, a comma, and then some (messy) information about roles they played in the programme. You'll need to extract only the name and add it to a list. You might use the `.split()` [method](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.split) to process each line.

- my solution:

  ```py
  def create_cast_list(filename):
      cast_list = []
      #use with to open the file filename
      #use the for loop syntax to process each line
      #and add the actor name to cast_list
      with open(filename) as f:
          for line in f:
              cast_list.append(line.split(",")[0])

      return cast_list

  cast_list = create_cast_list('flying_circus_cast.txt')
  for actor in cast_list:
      print(actor)
  ```

- answer:
  - add a new variable `name` to separate into two lines

  ```py
  def create_cast_list(filename):
      cast_list = []
      with open(filename) as f:
          for line in f:
              name = line.split(",")[0]
              cast_list.append(name)

      return cast_list

  cast_list = create_cast_list('flying_circus_cast.txt')
  for actor in cast_list:
      print(actor)
  ```
